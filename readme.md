Diabetes Prediction using Logistic regression and Scikit-Learn

First we will have to import the necessary modules
You can use either Anaconda, Jupyter notebook or Vs code to write your code

We’ll be using Python and some of its popular data science related packages. First of all, we will import pandas to read our data from a CSV file and manipulate it for further use. We will also use numpy to convert out data into a format suitable to feed our classification model. We’ll use seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations. We will then import Logistic Regression algorithm from sklearn. This algorithm will help us build our classification model. Lastly, we will use joblib available in sklearn to save our model for future use.

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip

pip3 install matplotib
pip3 install seaborn
pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install joblib ##for storage of data for future use

pip3 install pandas
